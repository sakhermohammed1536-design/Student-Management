# UI/UX Design Notes – By Sakher

As the UI/UX designer, I contributed to the project by reviewing and improving the interface.

### Form Layout
- Aligned labels and input fields.
- Standardized font sizes.

### Colors & Theme
- Suggested light theme for clarity.
- Unified button colors (blue = main action, red = delete).

### User Experience
- Tooltips for input fields.
- Confirmation messages on add/delete actions.
- Placeholder text for better guidance.

### Navigation
- Added menu suggestions for easier navigation.
